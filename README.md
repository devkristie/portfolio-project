# Codecademy Portfolio Project

This is my personal **Codecademy Portfolio Project** built to showcase the web development skills I've acquired through Codecademy courses. The portfolio features several key projects, each demonstrating my ability to use various front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

With a focus on clean design, responsiveness, accessibility, and interactivity, this portfolio reflects my growth as a developer, as well as my passion for creating engaging user experiences. The website is designed to be both visually appealing and fully functional across different devices.
